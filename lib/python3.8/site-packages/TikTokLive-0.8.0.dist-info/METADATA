<!-- [![Downloads](https://pepy.tech/badge/tiktoklive)](https://pepy.tech/project/tiktoklive) -->

A python library to receive and decode livestream events such as comments and gifts in real-time from TikTok's LIVE service by connecting to TikTok's internal WebCast push service. This library includes a wrapper that
connects to the WebCast service using only a user's `unique_id` and allows you to join your livestream as well as that of other streamers. No credentials are required to use TikTok-Live-Connector.

This library is a nearly 1:1 python implementation of the Javascript
[TikTok-Livestream-Chat-Connector](https://github.com/zerodytrash/TikTok-Livestream-Chat-Connector)
by [@zerodytrash](https://github.com/zerodytrash/) meant to serve as an alternative for users who feel more comfortable working in Python.

This is **not** an official API. It's a reverse engineering and research project.

## Getting started

1. Install the module via pip

```
pip install TikTokLive
```

2. Create your first chat connection

```python
from TikTokLive import TikTokLiveClient
from TikTokLive.types.events import CommentEvent, ConnectEvent

# Instantiate the client with the user's username
client: TikTokLiveClient = TikTokLiveClient(unique_id="@isaackogz")


# Define how you want to handle specific events via decorator
@client.on("connect")
async def on_connect(_: ConnectEvent):
    print("Connected to Room ID:", client.room_id)


# Notice no decorator?
async def on_comment(event: CommentEvent):
    print(f"{event.user.nickname} -> {event.comment}")


# Define handling an event via "callback"
client.add_listener("comment", on_comment)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Run the client and block the main thread
    # await client.start() to run non-blocking
    client.run()
```

## Events

A `TikTokLiveClient` object has the following events. You can add events either by doing `client.add_listener("event_name", callable)` or by decorating a function with `@client.on("event_name")` that includes an event
payload parameter.

### `connect`

Triggered when the connection gets successfully established.

```python
@client.on("connect")
async def on_connect(event: ConnectEvent):
    print("Connected")
```

### `disconnect`

Triggered when the connection gets disconnected. You can call `start()`  to have reconnect . Note that you should wait a little bit before attempting a reconnect to to avoid being rate-limited.

```python
@client.on("disconnect")
async def on_disconnect(event: DisconnectEvent):
    print("Disconnected")
```

### `like`

Triggered every time someone likes the stream.

```python
@client.on("like")
async def on_like(event: LikeEvent):
    print("Someone liked the stream!")
```

### `join`

Triggered every time a new person joins the stream.

```python
@client.on("join")
async def on_join(event: JoinEvent):
    print("Someone joined the stream!")
```

### `gift`

Triggered every time a gift arrives. Extra information can be gleamed off the `available_gifts` client attribute.
> **NOTE:** Users have the capability to send gifts in a streak. This increases the `data.gift.repeat_count` value until the user terminates the streak. During this time new gift events are triggered again and again with an increased `data.gift.repeat_count` value. It should be noted that after the end of the streak, another gift event is triggered, which signals the end of the streak via `data.gift.repeat_end`:`1`. This applies only to gifts with `data.gift.gift_type`:`1`. This means that even if the user sends a `gift_type`:`1` gift only once, you will receive the event twice. Once with `repeat_end`:`0` and once with `repeat_end`:`1`. Therefore, the event should be handled as follows:

```python
@client.on("gift")
async def on_gift(event: GiftEvent):
    # If it's type 1 and the streak is over
    if event.gift.gift_type == 1 and event.gift.repeat_end == 1:
        print(f"{event.user.uniqueId} sent {event.gift.repeat_count}x \"{event.gift.extended_gift.name}\"")

    # It's not type 1, which means it can't have a streak & is automatically over
    elif event.gift.gift_type != 1:
        print(f"{event.user.uniqueId} sent \"{event.gift.extended_gift.name}\"")
```

### `follow`

Triggered every time someone follows the streamer.

```python
@client.on("follow")
async def on_follow(event: FollowEvent):
    print("Someone followed the streamer!")
```

### `share`

Triggered every time someone shares the stream.

```python
@client.on("share")
async def on_share(event: ShareEvent):
    print("Someone shared the streamer!")
```

### `viewer_count_update`

Triggered every time the viewer count is updated. This event also updates the cached viewer count by default.

```python
@client.on("viewer_count_update")
async def on_connect(event: ViewerCountUpdateEvent):
    print("Received a new viewer count:", event.viewCount)
```

### `comment`

Triggered every time someone comments on the live

```python
@client.on("comment")
async def on_connect(event: CommentEvent):
    print(f"{event.user.nickname} -> {event.comment}")
```

### `live_end`

Triggered when the live stream gets terminated by the host.

```python
@client.on("live_end")
async def on_connect(event: LiveEndEvent):
    print(f"Livestream ended :(")
```

### `unknown`

Triggered when an unknown event is received that is not yet handled by this client

```python
@client.on("live_end")
async def on_connect(event: UnknownEvent):
    print(event.as_dict, "<- This is my data as a dict!")
```
